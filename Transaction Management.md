In Mule 4, a transaction is a mechanism that ensures the integrity and consistency of data during the execution of a flow. It provides a way to group operations so that they either complete successfully or, in case of failure, roll back to maintain data consistency. 
Mule 4 transactions ensure that either all operations within a transaction are successful, or none of them are executed (rolled back), preventing partial updates.

Transaction Types
Mule supports Single Resource (Local, the default) and Extended Architecture (XA) transaction types (transactionType). 
1. Local Transactions (Single Resource Transactions):
  Description: A local transaction is a simple transaction that operates within a single resource or system, such as a single database or a single JMS queue. In Mule 4, this type of transaction ensures that multiple operations within that resource are either fully committed or fully rolled back. Local transactions do not involve multiple systems or resources.
  Use Case: These are used when you are working with a single system or resource, for example, a single database or JMS queue, where the operations within that resource need to be atomic.
2. XA Transactions (Distributed Transactions)
  Description: XA transactions allow you to manage distributed transactions across multiple resources or systems. These transactions are more complex than local transactions and require a transaction manager to coordinate the commit and rollback processes across multiple resources (e.g., a database and a message queue, or multiple databases).
  Use Case: XA transactions are typically used in scenarios where you need to ensure consistency and atomicity across multiple systems. This is especially important in environments where data is spread across different databases or message brokers.
