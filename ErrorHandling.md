Global Error Handling:
You created a separate configuration XML file to manage global error handling across the entire application.
Error Handler Component:
Used an error handler component that works in conjunction with the on-error-propagate and on-error-continue properties to handle different types of errors.
  The on-error-propagate allows errors to be passed up to the calling flow.
  The on-error-continue ensures that the flow continues even if an error occurs.
Handling Uncaptured Errors:
For errors that are not explicitly captured, you included a generic error type (e.g., ANY error type) to cover unhandled errors.
Global Element for Configuration:
A global element called configuration was created to mention a default error handler, ensuring that this handler is applied application-wide.
Component-Level Error Handling:
At the component level, error handling can be achieved using the try block.
Flow-Level Error Handling:
Error handling at the flow level can be defined at the bottom of the flow to catch and manage errors for a specific flow.
Project-Level Error Handling:
For error handling across the entire project, the global error handler is configured to apply globally.
